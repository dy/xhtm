_XHTM_ is alternative implementation of [HTM](https://ghub.io/htm) without HTM-specific limitations.
Low-level machinery is rejected in favor of readability and better HTML support.

## Differences from HTM

* Self-closing tags support `` htm`<input><br>` `` ‚Üí `[h('input'), h('br')]`.
* HTML directives `<!doctype>`, `<?xml?>` etc. support [#91](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/91).
* Optionally closed tags support `<p>foo<p>bar` ‚Üí `<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>` [#91](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/91).
* Interpolated props are exposed as arrays `` html`<a class="a ${b} c"/>` `` ‚Üí `h('a', { class: ['a ', b, ' c'] })`.
* Calculated tag names [#109](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/109) support.
* Ignoring null-like arguments (customizable) [#129](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/129).
* Spaces formatting closer to HTML; elements with preserved formatting ([#23](https://github.com/dy/xhtm/issues/23)).
* No integrations exported, no babel compilers.
* No cache.

<!--
* Dynamic attribute names [#124](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/124).
* Spaces are compatible with HTML (customizable) [#128](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/128).
* Escaping quotes [#96](https://github.com/developit/htm/issues/96).

## Installation & Usage


[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/xhtm.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/xhtm/)

`xhtm` is by default fully compatible with `htm` and can be used as drop-in replacement.

```js
import htm from 'xhtm'
import { render, h } from 'preact'

html = htm.bind(h)

render(html`
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>Some paragraph<br>
  <p>Another paragraph
`, document.getElementById('app'))
```

For `htm` manual, refer to [htm docs](https://ghub.io/htm).

## Justification

Generally HTM is a better choice, since it has better performance and enables caching.<br/>
But if your app doesn't render components frequently or you need HTML support, then XHTM can be a good choice.  
Originally that was just minimal HTML parser implementation (~60LOC), best from 10 variants in R&D branches.<br/>
